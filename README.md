# About the Project

- This is an random advice generator application created using the [Advice Slip Api](https://api.adviceslip.com/).


# Getting Started
- This project can be accessed by cloning the github repository onto your desktop. You do not need a specific key to access this application but you will need to start up a bundler such as the one I used for this application which was [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/). 

```
cd /desktop
git clone git@github.com:hydeiablakey/Advice_Slip.git
cd /Advice_Slip
yarn add
yarn start (works only if you have yarn installed)
```
